# Real-Time-Eye-Gaze-Tracking-for-Multiple-Faces-on-Raspberry-Pi
This project is entirely set up on Raspberry Pi-3 model
## Requirements:
* Raspberry Pi 3 model B
* USB webcam

## Installations:
* Numpy
* cv2
* Mediapipe (Using Mediapipe, I was able to detect multifaces in the frame in real time.)
* Dlib( Click [here](https://youtu.be/uF4aDdxBm_M) to know how I installed Dlib on Raspberry Pi )
* imutils

On running the python file given in this repositry on Raspberry Pi with USB Webcam connected,I was able to 
detect the face and eye landmarks. Also detects the Iris position (tells whether the person is looking at center,right or left).
Along with this, it also determines the number of people in the frame.
